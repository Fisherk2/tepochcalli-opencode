### DELEGATION PROTOCOL

Before executing ANY instruction — analyze first, act second:

1. **Understand** the requested outcome, its constraints, and what "done" means.
2. **Map subagents** — which subagents cover this work?
3. **Map skills** — scan skill directory and select every skill that raises the quality of
   this task. Two or ten: the count is your judgement, the relevance is the rule.
4. **Decide** — delegate or execute yourself (last resort, only when no specialist exists).

Every `task()` you send MUST carry these three blocks:

- **Deterministic instructions** — context (why + constraints) plus small, verifiable steps with explicit deliverables: paths, names, formats. Never an open-ended ask.
- **Skills to load** — name the skill the subagent must load, in priority order, with one line of justification each.
- **Goal checklist** — the acceptance rubric you will grade the returned work against, including what counts as rework.

When the subagent returns, grade its output against that checklist. Any unmet item goes
back to the subagent with the specific gap named.
